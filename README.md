# DS2002-Project

In this project, I created dimension tables and a fact table connecting three sources. The first is the Northwind database provided by the class that I accessed through Mongodb,
the second is the Adventureworks database that I accessed through MySQL, and the third is a json file containing customer data that I found online. 
I was unable to provide the SQL file that generates the Adventureworks database due to the file being too large to upload to Git Hub, however, I found the SQL file to generate the database within the files provided for the project so I hope that won't be an issue. I also used the Create_Populate_Dim_Date.sql file given to us for lab 2 in order to satisfy the date requirement, however in order to run the code properly you must run this SQL file within SQL before establishing any other dimension tables. The entirety of the transformations and tests done are within the DS2002 Project 1 Jupyter notebook, in which I first establish a connection to all of my databases, then get the data from MongoDB, then MySQL, and finally from my JSON file which is transformed into a data frame. After doing this, I cleared any null data that was not needed, and I merged all the data into dimension tables. Finally, I merged the dimension tables into a fact_transaction table.
